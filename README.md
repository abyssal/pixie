<h1>üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pixie</h1>
<i>"It's like systemctl, but online"</i>   
  
<code>com.abyssaldev.pixie</code>

An application server-side management daemon & service mesh, written in Kotlin  
Runs on top of `systemctl`.  
Features a RESTful control API, a web interface, and live CRUD operations.  
There's a CLI too.  
Super simple to use and even easier to maintain.  
Adapted from internal tooling at GalEdu.

### What can Pixie do?
**Pixie can:**
- Manage your application process(es)
- Connect them to each other, loosely-coupled (processes are unaware of other processes existing)
- Dynamically handle process drop-in drop-out (client disconnect, process crashes, scale up/down), without restarting all clients
- Report process crashes to an exception handling service
- Fault detection for otherwise non-fault-resistant runtimes (used extensively with the JVM)
- Replace Docker/Kubernetes for small-scale setups (where D/K8S would be *overkill*)

**Pixie can't:**
- Route network requests outside Pixie clusters (`nginx` recommended)
- Act as a firewall between Pixie clients & clusters
- Isolate Pixie clients (coming soon)
- Replace a well-configured Docker/Kubernetes setup for big projects
- Make your breakfast (do it yourself)
- Run on Windows/Windows Server

### Example usage
**CLI**
```console
abyss@cpu:~$ pixie client create-spec --file=abyss-client.json --run-now=false
== pixie 0.10.2 on cpu @ 1:08AM Sun 10 Jan NZDT ==
pixie-json: opened `abyss-client.json`
pixie-client-create: created client "Abyss Pixie Client" (use --debug to print client info)
pixie: finished in 652 milliseconds
== pixie ending ==
abyss@cpu:~$ pixie start abyss-client
== pixie 0.10.2 on cpu @ 1:09AM Sun 10 Jan NZDT ==
pixie-client-connect: connected to pixie mesh on localhost:11808
pixie-client-connect: sent START_CLIENT message for abyss-client
pixie-client-connect: received acknowledgement
== pixie ending ==
abyss@cpu:~$ pixie logs abyss-client --follow
== pixie 0.10.2 on cpu @ 1:09AM Sun 10 Jan NZDT ==
pixie-client-logs: beginning log follow for abyss-client
...
```
